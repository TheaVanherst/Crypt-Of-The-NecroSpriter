to test sprites, open up the 'Main.html' file with any browser.
For full support, I would highly recommend firefox.

To test your animations, replace the spritesheets in the 'Characters' folder, and refresh the page.
if you want any assistance in using the tool, designing sprites or have any
recommendations for the sprite renderer, contact me on Twitter or my discord TheaVanherst#1953.

[*] The renderer doesn't use a 100% accurate dance pattern, but is accurate enough to 
represent the actual dance pattern, the math is accurate but there's probably some optimisation issues.
